# 🐍 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp 🚀

This repository documents my journey through **100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by **Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.** The goal is to build **100 Python projects in 100 days** to solidify my understanding of Python programming and gain practical experience.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To complete one new, independent project each day for 100 consecutive days, applying the concepts learned in the course to build a diverse portfolio of Python applications.

## 📅 Structure

The repository is organized by day, with each day's work contained in its own folder (e.g., Day 001, Day 002, etc.).

**Folder Contents:**

+ **Code:** The Python script(s) for the day's project.

+ **Documentation:** A brief description or a README.md summarizing the project, the concepts used, and any challenges faced.

+ **Assets (if necessary):** Any required input files, images, or data.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Covered

This course and its projects cover a vast range of Python topics. Key areas include:

* **Fundamentals:** Variables, data types, control flow, functions.

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, inheritance, encapsulation.

* **GUI Development:** Using libraries like Tkinter and Turtle.

* **Web Development:** Flask, REST APIs, HTML/CSS.

* **Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy, data analysis.

* **Automation:** Working with files, web scraping (Beautiful Soup, Selenium).
